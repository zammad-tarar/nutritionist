## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project helped me practice structuring semantic HTML, applying responsive styles, and improving my CSS skills. One key takeaway was refining the use of flexbox for layout structuring.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued Development

Future improvements may include adding animations, better accessibility features, and refining responsiveness for various screen sizes.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Always a great resource for web development.
